                    <h3>Picking the right Hiking Gear!</h3>
                    <p>The nice thing about beginning hiking is that you don’t really need any special gear, you can
                        probably get away with things you already have.
                        Let’s start with clothing. A typical mistake hiking beginners make is wearing jeans and
                        regular clothes, which will get heavy and chafe wif they get sweaty or wet.</p>

                <h3>Understand Your Map & Timing</h3>
                <p>To start, print out the hiking guide and map. If it’s raining, throw them in a Zip-Lock bag. Read
                    over the guide, study the map, and have a good idea of what to expect. I like to know what my
                    next landmark is as I hike. For example, I’ll read the guide and know that say, in a mile, I
                    make a right turn at the junction..</p>
